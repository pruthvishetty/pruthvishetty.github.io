# Another Hoot

The branch I knew begins to thin,
Its bark still warm with prints of kin.
Yet in the dusk another calls,
A twin of feathers, perched on walls.

Two owls in twilight, eyes the same,
But each with fire of different flame.
The first once taught me how to see,
The next now whispers, come with me.

I fly from shade I called my own,
Toward echoes of a voice long known.
The moon reminds, with calm intent,
Change is the lone true testament.
