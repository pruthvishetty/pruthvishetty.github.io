# Thread Count

I fret and scroll for shirts to buy,
Debating stripes or navy dye.
Yet day by day, with zero qualms,
I live in tees from hackathons.

A logo here, a slogan there,
From startups gone or still mid-air
Some gifted swag, some office wear,
All proof that I was once somewhere.

I paid for none, yet here they stay,
My realest fits were given away.
So when the urge to shop takes hold,
I'll count the threads my keystrokes sold.

For most my closet, truth be told,
Was earned through code, not bought with gold
