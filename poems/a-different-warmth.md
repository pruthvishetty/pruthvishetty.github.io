# A Different Warmth

The name has changed, the air is new
no steel, no spice, no old menu.
Yet steam still curls with quiet grace,
a different warmth, the same old place.

The walls don't speak, but I still hear
a whisper steeped in yesteryear.
One cup is gone, another pours
both warm the hands, just as before.
