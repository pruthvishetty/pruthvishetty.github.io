# The Generous Man

He placed the bread into her palm,
a coin, a coat, a gentle word
and in the mirror of her thanks
he saw himself, his kindness heard.

The cost to him was thin as air,
a trifle skimmed from comfort's hoard;
yet in his chest he felt the crown
that kings of mercy often afford.

Would he have given, when the days
left nothing spare to call his own?
would he have shared his single meal
and faced the night with hunger grown?

The truest gift forgets the hand,
its giving done as rivers should;
he gave only what he could spare,
and kept the rest for winter's snow.
