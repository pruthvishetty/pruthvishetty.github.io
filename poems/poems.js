    content: `# Digital Dreams

*In circuits bright and silicon deep,*
*Where binary thoughts in darkness sleep,*
*We weave our dreams in lines of code,*
*Each algorithm a travelled road.*

*Yet in this maze of ones and zeros,*
*We search for meaning, hearts our heroes,*
*For technology's but a mirror's face,*
*Reflecting back our human grace.*

*So let us code with conscious mind,*
*And build a future, true and kind,*
*Where man and machine in concert play,*
*And poetry lives in each new day.*

---

*Written in reflection on the balance between technological progress and human values.*
