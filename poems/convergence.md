# Convergence

We start as scattered points in space,
each wandering at a different pace;
No label, tribe, or fate in sight,
just random paths through day and night.

The pull of nearness starts to guide,
to centers where our likes reside.
Iteration shifts our chosen ground,
till fewer strays are left unbound.

The clusters form, the spread grows tight,
old friendships fade, new bonds ignite.
And when the algorithm's done at last,
we find our future in our past.
