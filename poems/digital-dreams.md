# Digital Dreams

In circuits bright and silicon deep,
Where binary thoughts in darkness sleep,
We weave our dreams in lines of code,
Each algorithm a travelled road.

Yet in this maze of ones and zeros,
We search for meaning, hearts our heroes,
For technology's but a mirror's face,
Reflecting back our human grace.

So let us code with conscious mind,
And build a future, true and kind,
Where man and machine in concert play,
And poetry lives in each new day.
