        <p>I like spending my time tinkering with hobby projects, taking walks with my wife, catching up with friends, playing racquetball, swimming, and making chai. I am on a lifelong quest to learn new languages. Lately, I’ve become interested in learning more about finance & public policy. <a href="https://medium.com/pruthvi-shetty/the-bookmark-67aa0993155a">Here</a> is a collection of my favorite stuff that I enjoy watching, listening to or reading.</p>
